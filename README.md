# 02-Responsive-Portfolio

The objective of this project is to familiarize myself with Bootstrap 4 and responsive design.

In doing so, I need to create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` and develop my portfolio site with the following items:

-   A navbar

-   A responsive layout

-   Responsive images

Furthermore, the Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

### Minimum Requirements

Here are the minimum requirements:

-   Functional, deployed application

-   GitHub repository with README describing the project

-   Navbar must be consistent on each page.

-   Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

-   All links must work.

-   Must use semantic html.

-   Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

-   Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

-   Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus

The bonus part is to make a `sticky footer` and use `sub-rows` and `sub-column` on my portfolio site.

## Submission on BCS

I am required to submit the following:

-   The URLs of the deployed applications

-   The URLs of the GitHub repositories
