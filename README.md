# 02-Responsive-Portfolio

### Description

This repository (02-Responsive-Portfolio) is my personal portfolio by utilising the advantages of Bootstrap 4. The objective of this responsive portfolio is to create a mobile-first application and to render it well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

In doing so, I have created `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` and develop my portfolio site with the following items:

-   A navbar

-   A responsive layout

-   Responsive images

### Features

-   On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen.

-   Navbar must be consistent on each page.

-   Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

-   All links must work.

-   Must use semantic html.

-   Furthermore, the Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

#### Improvements

-   Navbar could be further improved with collapse button.

-   Image could be more fluid when changing screen sizes.
